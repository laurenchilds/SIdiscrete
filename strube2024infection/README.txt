directorystructure
------------------
Code/				: Directory of MATLAB codes and scripts necessary for strube2024infection_driver.m function
Data/				: Empty Directory - should include .mat files used in the reproduction of manuscript figures. See Note 1 below.
strube2024infection_NewFigures/	: Empty directory for storage of new figures
strube2024infection_NewData/	: Empty directory for storage of new data
strube2024infection_driver.m	: Driver script. Prints prompts to the command line. Push "run" to get started for all data and figure creation. See Notes below.

Note 1: Due to large matrices necessary for figure files, the Data is available by request from L. Strube (LFstrube@gmail.com)

Note 2: Due to the risk of accidentally storing large quantities of figure files. The figure storage functionality has been commented out of the driver script. Interested users may uncomment this code but should be sure they understand the memory requirements prior to using automated figure storage. 

Note 3: Code/README.txt includes full description on all MATLAB codes used by strube2024infection_driver.m. The codes in Code/ folder do not run independently without properly formatted inputs.

Note 4: Code generated plots may differ slightly due to numerical error based on rounding precision,  but do not qualitatively change results. Known discrepancies with Figs. 6 and C2.
