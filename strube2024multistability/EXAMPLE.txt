To generate simulations related to the disease-free system (u=0,w=1):

Choose options (at first 3 prompts):
- (2) Generate original data and figures
- (2) Generate new data and figures
- (2) Be prompted to enter your desired simulation conditions for a single run 

Then the following:
Would you like to record a run description? (Y=1/N=0) > 1
Enter a brief description here: > Test
Would you like to change any of them [Parameters]? (Y=1/N=0) > 0
Would you like to change any of them [Initial Conditions]? (Y=1/N=0) > 0
First Bifurcation Parameter:>1 
Second Bifurcation Parameter:> 3
Enter the desired increments for the first bifurcation parameter: [start,size,stop]> [0,.5,320]
Enter the desired increments for the second bifurcation parameter: [start,size,stop]>[0,0.001,1]
Enter your desired value of n. (recommended: 7) >7
What is your desired limit cycle threshold size? (recommended: 16) > 16
Enter the desired quantity of "transient" simulation time steps: (recommended: 10,000) > 10,000
How many time steps would you like to use in the generation of the orbit maps? (recommended: 48) >48
How many time steps would you like to use in the population average calculations? (recommended: 2,000) > 2000
Do you wish to proceed? Y=1/N=0  >1
 Would you like to use parallel processing (Strongly recommended, requires the Parallel Computing Toolbox) Y=1/N=0 >0


You will then be prompted with figure options.
